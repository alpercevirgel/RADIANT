### RADIANT <img src="logo.png" width="200" align="right" /> 

R-based Analytical tool for DIfferential ANalysis of cyTometry data (RADIANT) is an analysis pipeline built by incorporating available R libraries in a user friendly way.

With RADIANT, you can effortlessly clean (PeacoQC), transform, normalize batch effects (CytoNorm) and cluster (FlowSOM) your data. We have also integrated the Cross Entropy test, which enables both the testing of healthy batch control samples and the biological samples.

We are currently preparing a manuscript that demonstrates the full potential of RADIANT.
